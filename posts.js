		content: "On our last day of the unit, we talked about fission and fusion. To summarize briefly:<br>Nuclear fusion occurs when two lighter atomic nuclei are thrown together with great force, forming a heavier nucleus.<br>Nuclear fission occurs when the nucleus of an atom splits into lighter nuclei. This is possible because of the mass defect that is created; the energy released is equal to the mass defect."

The process was random, and we didn’t know which Skittles would face up on each toss, but the end result still showed that the number of Skittles decreased roughly by half every time. Our sugar intake also rose on every toss.<br>Later on, we tackled the problem of Fongitis and put our skills regarding half-lives to the test."

A few things we covered:</p><ul><li>In an atom, there are protons and neutrons that make up its nucleus - an isotope of an atom is an element with a different amount of neutrons, but the same number of protons.<li>A radioisotope is an isotope of an element that is unstable and will spontaneously change its structure, releasing energy in the form of radiation.<li>The strong force exerts itself between nucleons (protons and neutrons), and pulls together the nucleus. It is very strong, thus overpowering the electrostatic force repelling the protons apart.<li>During radioactive decay, a parent atom undergoes a transmutation to form a daughter atom and other products. There may or may not be a transmutation on every decay.<li>The three main types of decays are alpha decay (releases helium-4 atoms), beta decay (releases electrons or positrons in beta-negative and beta-positive decay), and gamma decay (releases gamma particles that have no weight). There is also electron capture, where the parent atom receives an electron to transmute into another atom.<li>Some questions still remain - how long does it take for a radioisotope to decay? How do we determine whether or not an isotope is stable or not?</ul><p>We also played a game called radiatioN, where we used our knowledge of radioactive decays to get more points."

		content: "It was quite exciting today - Mr. Fong had three experiments running at once!<br>We were introduced to the concept of latent heat today, which is the energy absorbed or released by a substance. Specific latent heat is the latent heat of 1 kg of material; this is used to calculate the amount of energy required for the material to change states. The equation is Q=mL, where Q is the energy, m is the mass, and L is the specific latent heat. A material can have two different specific latent heats - one for fusion (solid to/from liquid), and one for vaporization (liquid to/from gas).<br>For the experiments, there were three things happening at once: ice melting, a bird “drinking” water, and boiling water with ice. In the first experiment, we watched the temperature graph of ice melting; the result reflected what we learned about specific latent heat - at 0°C, the energy put into the ice went towards changing its state and the particle's’ potential energy, rather than their kinetic energy and temperature. Thus, water existed at 0°C due to specific latent heat. The bird drinking water had to do with the evaporation point of the alcohol inside the bird, but Mr. Fong wouldn’t tell us the details. Finally, we had an exciting time watching Mr. Fong boil hot-but-not-boiling water by placing ice around the glass (which worked due to changes in pressure… or something).<br><br><video width='100%' height='auto' autoplay muted loop controls><source src='img/18video.mov'></video>"

Well, we burned money.<br>Well, kind of - we burned the water-alcohol-salt solution soaked in the money. Why did it work? Alcohol is flammable, so that is what the flame was burning; water, as we learned in the calorimetry Gizmo, has a very high specific heat capacity, thus absorbing the heat from the flame. This way, the flame would not actually burn the money. The salt was added to make the flame a different colour. Each day in physics is quite exciting."

		content: "To review our knowledge of heat, we created a mindmap (pictured to the right).<br>We watched a video about the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales, and I learned that Fahrenheit didn’t actually invent the modern-day Fahrenheit scale. To demonstrate how different objects conduct heat differently, we placed ice cubes on a metal and plastic dish; the ice cube on the metal dish melted faster because metal conducts heat easier. I learned that even though the metal dish and plastic lid felt like they were at different temperatures, they were the same - they only felt different because thermal energy from my hand transferred at a quicker rate to the metal than the plastic.<br>In addition to these things, we looked at the specific heat capacity of objects, which is the amount of energy required to change 1 kg of the object by 1°C. To demonstrate this, we had took two balloons: one with some water inside, and the other only filled with air. When placed over a flame, the balloon with only air inside immediately popped, as the rubber heated until it broke. However, the balloon with some water inside withstood the flame for a few seconds until it burst. The thermal energy was transferred to the water inside, which has a high specific heat capacity, and instead of going into the rubber only, the thermal energy was transferred to the water first, protecting the balloon for a short period of time.<br>To calculate the specific heat capacity, I learned that we can use the equation Q=mCT, where Q = Thermal Energy, m = Mass, C = specific heat capacity, and T = Temperature. I’m left wondering whether or not it takes more energy for a material to change states, and how to calculate it if there is additional energy required.<br><br><video width='50%' height='auto' autoplay muted loop controls><source src='img/16video1.mp4'></video><video width='50%' height='auto' autoplay muted loop controls><source src='img/16video2.mov'></video>"

		content: "An interesting device that we looked at today was a barrel that could climb up inclines after rolling down (which I will now refer to as “Roy”). Although Mr. Fong didn’t show us how Roy worked, using my knowledge of energy, I have hypothesized the general principles of the system. At the top of the ramp, Roy has gravitational potential energy (GPE), no kinetic energy (KE), and no elastic energy (EE). When Roy starts moving down the ramp, the GPE is converted into motion, or KE. At the same time, Roy has some sort of an elastic or spring inside that converts the KE into EE. As Roy continues to roll down the ramp, it gets faster until the mechanism inside converts most of the KE into EE. At that point, Roy stops rolling down, and the spring/elastic system starts its magic. Since the spring stored energy in the direction that Roy was facing on the way down (counterclockwise, for example), then the mechanism wants to return to its original state - meaning that the spring wants to turn Roy in the opposite direction (clockwise). This forces Roy to start rolling up the ramp, turning its stored EE into KE; as Roy moves up the ramp, the KE is converted into GPE.<br>In a world where Roy loses no energy to external factors, Roy would return back to the top of the incline. However, the final position was very far from the top of the ramp. This means that not all of the GPE was converted back, and mechanical energy was not conserved. Since energy is neither destroyed nor created, this means that Roy lost energy to things such as friction and sound.<br>As with the poppers, how do we calculate exactly how much each factor contributed to taking energy from Roy’s energy system?"

		content: "How much power does it take to walk up the stairs? But wait - what is power? Today, I learned what physics defines power as; it is the ratio between the amount of work done (W) to the time taken to do the work (∆t). The resulting equation is P = W/∆t, which gives the units joules/seconds. This unit, joule/second, is equal to a watt (W). After learning the concept of power, we applied our knowledge to find out the amount of power each of us use to climb stairs. When climbing stairs, the change in energy is being measured between two different moments in time, so the only energy that changes is the GPE. Therefore, the work done is equivalent to the change in GPE, which is equal to mgh. I climbed the 1.26m-tall set of stairs, so with my mass being 77 kg and the acceleration due to gravity 9.8 m/s^2, 951 J of energy was used to complete the work. Because I took 6.94 seconds to climb the staircase, I used 137 watts of power."

		video: "9media.mp4",
		content: "Our class had fun playing with poppers today! Our goal was to find out whether or not poppers conserve mechanical energy. Upon looking into how poppers work, we determined that energy is transferred in the following manner: elastic energy → kinetic energy → gravitational potential energy → kinetic energy. By popping in the popper, we stored elastic energy into the rubber material - the eventual release of that energy pushed the popper up (kinetic energy). The popper slowed down as the KE converted into GPE, which turned back into KE on its way down. However, due to things like air resistance/friction and the release of sound energy, not all of the original elastic energy was transformed into kinetic motion.<br>Although we were not able to gather real data from the poppers, here’s a hypothetical situation:<br>To measure the amount of energy input into the popper, we need to know the amount of energy used to push it in. We can do this by continuing to add a certain amount of weight on top of the popper until it pops in. Let’s say that we needed to add a 1kg weight, and the amount that the popper pops in is 5cm. The force this applies, using the equation Eg=mgh (the weight of the weight), is 1kg x 10ms^(-2) x 0.05m = 0.5J.<br>When the popper is placed onto the table and launched into the air, it converts its elastic potential energy into gravitational potential energy; again, we use the equation Eg=mgh. This time, we use the mass of the popper, 0.1kg, and the height that it reaches. Let’s say that the popper jumped to a height of 1 metre. The energy would therefore equal  0.1kg x 10ms^(-2) x 1m = 0.1J. So, the actual amount of energy put into the jump was 0.1J, and not 0.5J.<br>To find the percentage efficiency of the popper, we can calculate: 0.1J/0.5J x 100% = 20%. Therefore, the popper only used 20% of the energy that we put in. Imagine how high it could get at 100% efficiency.<br>This leaves me with a question: How do we measure the amount of energy lost to sound energy and friction (separately)?"

		content: "We applied what we’ve learned so far today through the ramp race demonstration. To summarize the demonstration, two marbles are released at the top of two different ramps; one longer, and one shorter. The height of the two ramps are equal, so which marble reaches the end point first? Due to the conservation of mechanical energy, the gravitational potential energy of each marble should be the same at the top of the ramp, and when they reach the bottom of the ramp, that GPE will be converted into KE. Thus, the kinetic energy of both marbles should be the same once they reach the bottom of their respective ramps. However, since the marble on the shorter ramp reaches maximum velocity first, it travels at a quicker speed for a longer period of time, and reaches the end first.<br>The demonstration confirmed the theory, and the marble sent down the shorter ramp won the race. However, how would friction affect the race if it was greater or smaller?"

		content: "Mr. Fong challenged our knowledge of energy with a problem concerning roller coasters today (question in the picture). My answer was: The rear car will be moving the fastest at the bottom of the incline due to the interactions between each car. Because the front of the car reaches the bottom first, the front carts will have their gravitational potential energy converted into kinetic energy before the carts at the back. Since the carts in the front have more kinetic energy than the carts at the back, their momentum pulls the rear of the car forward, making it go faster.<br>Edit: The correct answer was the middle car, since at that point, the largest amount of gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. That makes sense, since all carts move at the same speed; when I gave my answer, I thought the question was asking which individual cart was moving the fastest, and I somehow tricked myself into believing that the rear car would move at the quickest speed."

Relying on my trusty cell phone and satellite communication, I was able to work out the problems. However, there’s quite a lot pertaining to energy transformations during a phone call, right? Signals need to be transmitted from my end all the way to the other phone - so how is that information communicated? From my knowledge of energy, I think that there is definitely electrical energy at work in transmission cables, but how do satellites communicate information? What type of energy would electromagnetic radiation count as? Upon further research, I have found that it is radiant energy, the same classification as light energy.<br>Communication is a large part of our current society, and each method of transferring data requires energy.

This is due to the direction that the force affects the object in relation to the object’s displacement; this angle can be incorporated into the work equation. If the force is in the same direction to the motion of the object, there is positive work, but if the work done and the displacement are in opposing directions, there is negative work. The resulting equation is W=|F||∆d|cosθ.<br>One interesting idea brought up is that even when force is used, there may not be any work done from a physics perspective, even though energy is being exerted. If energy is used, but there is no work, then where does the energy go?<br>Energy is never created nor destroyed, since energy is conserved - this principle was tested out today in class with a pendulum. The pendulum, provided it is not pushed forward, will never return higher than its initial position. Due to the friction from the pivot point and air resistance, the pendulum actually reaches a lower point than its starting position. So the question is: How much would Mr. Fong’s hospital fees cost if the pendulum was accelerated forward?"
