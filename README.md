# EnergyPortfolio
An e-portfolio for the energy unit of my physics class.
Created without a CSS template (I find it satisfying for creating something without the bulk of the work done for me).
The inspiration is largely taken from Google's Material Design concept.
My first attempt at making a site with an adaptive design - it's a learning process!
